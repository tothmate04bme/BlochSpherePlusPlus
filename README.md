# BlochSpherePlusPlus

This is a Bloch sphere simulator created as an assignment solution for the Quantum computing subject of Budapest University of Technology (BME). It simulates a 1 bit quantum computer with various gates available through a GUI.

The project uses C++17 and Qt Widgets 6.8 (LTS), and provides pre-built binaries with most dependecies for bot Windows and Linux-based operating systems.
